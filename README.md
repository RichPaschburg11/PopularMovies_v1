Instructions to set the API key for The Movie Database (TMDb).

Edit the file app/src/main/java/com/paschburg/rich/popularmovies_v1/ApiKey.java.
Replace "PLACE API KEY HERE" with the API key.

Note: from the project root directory do the command:
   git update-index --assume-unchanged app/src/main/java/com/paschburg/rich/popularmovies_v1/ApiKey.java
Then if you insert the API key within the file, the changed file with the API key will 
not be synced to the public repository.

The API key was not committed to this repository.
